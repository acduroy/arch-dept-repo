How to effectively remove an md partition (software RAID) in Linux:

1. Identify the RAID device and partitions
   * Use cat /proc/mdstat to list active RAID devices. Note the device name (e.g. /dev/md0)
     and the member disks (e.g. /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb1)
   * Use lsblk to verify the partitions and their corresponding mount points
 
2. Unmount the RAID partition (if mounted)
   * sudo umount /path/to/mountpoint
   * remove the corresponding entry from /etc/fstab to prevent it from being automatically
     mounted on reboot
3. Stop the RAID device
   * Use sudo mdadm --stop /dev/mdX (replace X with the RAID device number)

4. Remove the RAID device from configuration
   * Edit /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf and remove the corresponding lines for the RAID device
   * Use sudo mdadm --remove /dev/mdX (replace X with the RAID device number)
5. Zero out the superblocks
   * For each member disk of the RAID array, use 
     sudo mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdX (replace X with the disk identifier, e.g. /dev/sda1)
     This step is crucial to remove the RAID metadata from the disks

6. Verify and clean up
   * After completing the above steps, you can verify that the RAID array is gone by checking the /proc/mdstat
   * You can use fdisk or parted to manage the individual partitions on the disks as needed.

7. Using dd command if the above commands are not available to make sure there was no weird data on the disk to
   confuse the Linux OS installer
   
   1st - to remove the first 100MBytes of the disk
         sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/$disk bs=1M count=100 status=progress oflag=sync
   
   2nd - since some raid scheme stored up the metadata at the last 20KBytes on the drive - zeroing these sectors
         are necessary
         sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1024 seek=(<blocks>-20) count=20

   Note: 
   <blocks> is the TOTAL number of bytes on the disk, divided by 1024.        
   Using fdisk you'll be able to see the total bytes of your drive. 
   Then divide that with 1024, you will get the total number of blocks in your sdd drive
   Ex below /dev/sda  total bytes = 960,197,124,096      
      blocks=960,197,124,096/1024 seek=937,692,504
